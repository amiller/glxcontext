If you need an OpenGL context for offscreen rendering, and don't
want to create a Wx or GTK window, this is the easiest way to do it.

Even on a headless machine (like a virtualbox), you can install
xvfb-run and use it with this package


Requirements:
   libx11
   Cython


Usage:
   import glxcontext
   from OpenGL.GL import glGetString, GL_VERSION

   glxcontext.makecurrent()
   print glGetString(GL_VERSION)

   # Now you can use OpenGL functions, for example creating an offscreen buffer
   # See tests/test_offscreen.py
